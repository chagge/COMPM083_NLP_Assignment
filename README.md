# COMPM083_NLP_Assignment

This project includes codes for three assignments of statistical natural language processing(UCL COMPM083)
  * Assignment 1: Language Models
  * Assignment 2: Event Extraction
  * Assignment 3: Sentence Representations for Sentiment Analysis on Twitter
 
### Runing Enviorment requirements:
  To run the code, the [stat-nlp-book](https://github.com/uclmr/stat-nlp-book) should be set up correctly.
  Then, git clone this project under the stat-nlp-book/src/main/scala/uk/ac/ucl/cs/mr/statnlpbook/ directory.
  
### Assignment 1: Language Models
  In this assignment, some language models and noisy channel model are implemented.
  
### Assignment 2: Event Extraction
  In this assignment, loglinear models and the perceptron are used to [BioNLP'09 Shared Task](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/tsujii/GENIA/SharedTask/) to extract bio-molecular events (bio-events) that appear in biomedical literature.
  
### Assignment 3: Sentence Representations for Sentiment Analysis on Twitter
  In this assignment will investigate representation learning for sentiment analysis of tweets.
  The bag-of-words-vector, simple RNN, GRU, bi-directional RCNN models are implemented had RCNN model 
  achieves the best performance
